# Helium Phase Diagram Visualizer  

A simple **Python GUI** built with **Tkinter**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**  
to visualize and export the **Phase Diagram of Helium**.  
This program allows users to input temperature and pressure values, plot them interactively,  
and export the results to Excel for further analysis.

## Project Overview

This project visualizes the **physical behavior of Helium** across different states.  
It displays three major scientific curves:

1. **Saturated Vapor Pressure Curve**  
2. **Lambda Line**  
3. **Melting Curve**

Users can also add their own data points and export them to Excel.  
Perfect for **students, researchers, and educators** in physics, cryogenics, and thermodynamics.
